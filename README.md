# research_of_sales_apartments
This research is based on the data from Yandex Real State service that shows the ads for sale apartments in San Petersburg for several years. The task is to determine the market value of the real state and set the parameters that will allow me to build an automated system to track anomalies and fraudulent activities.
There are two types of data available for each apartment for sale. The first one is entered by the user, the second one is obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, the airport, the nearest park, and reservoir.
